                    <h4>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h4>


                    <p>
                        Errors in a program are usually caused by one of the following:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>System error</b> ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the
                            program is interacting. </li>
                        <li><b>Programmer error</b> ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty
                            logic; it could even be as simple as a typo. </li>
                        <li><b>User error</b> ― the user has entered data incorrectly,
                            which the program is unable to handle.</li>
                    </ul>










                    <h4>Exceptions</h4>
                    <p>
                        An exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to
                        deal with the error. For example, trying to call a method that is nonexistent will result in a
                        reference error that raises an exception, as in the example below when you try to
                        call the <i>unicorn()</i> function:</p>


                    <pre class="code-snipet"> <code > unicorn();
<< ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined </code></pre>

                    <p>
                        An exception also produces a stack trace, which is a sequence of functions or method calls that
                        lead to the point where the error occurred. It’s often not just a single function or method call
                        that causes an error. A stack trace will work backwards from the point at which the error
                        occurred to identify the original function or method that started the sequence. The example
                        below shows how a stack trace can help you find where an error originates from:

                    </p>

                    <pre class="code-snipet"> <code >function three(){ unicorn(); }
function two(){ three(); }
function one(){ two(); }
one();

<< index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined 
at three (index.html:13) 
at two (index.html:17)
at one (index.html:21)
at index.html:24` </code></pre>


                    <p>In this example, we have three functions: function one() invokes function two(), which then
                        invokes function three(). Function three() then invokes the unicorn() function that doesn't
                        exist and causes an error. We can use the stack trace to work backwards and see that this error
                        was caused by invoking the function one() in the first place.</p>


                    <br>
                    <h4>Strict Mode</h4>
                    <p>Produces more exceptions and warnings and prohibits
                        the use of some deprecated features. This is due to the fact that strict mode considers coding
                        practices that were previously accepted as just being 'poor style' as actual errors.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Error Objects</h4>

                    <ul>
                        <li><em>EvalError</em>
                            is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for
                            backwards compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval()
                            function.
                        </li>
                        <li><em>RangeError </em>is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.</li>
                        <li><em>ReferenceError </em> is
                        thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function
                        that hasn't been defined.</li>
                        <li><em>SyntaxError </em>is thrown when there’s an error in the code’s syntax.</li>
                        <li><em>TypeError </em>is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is
                        used when a number is expected. </li>
                        <li><em>URIError </em> is thrown when there’s a problem encoding or decoding
                        the URI.</li>
                        <li><em>InternalError </em>is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the
                        JavaScript engine. A common cause of this too much recursion.</li>
                    </ul>
